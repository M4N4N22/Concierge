# AI-Powered File Insights & Vault Compute Flow

This update delivers a fully production-ready end-to-end AI compute and file insight workflow leveraging 0G Compute & Storage. It demonstrates our ability to securely process user files, generate domain-aware summaries, and manage ledger interactions seamlessly.

## Core Features

### End-to-End Compute Architecture

#### Compute Insights API

**File:** `app/api/computeInsights/route.ts`

Handles secure file ingestion, AI inference, and insight generation.

Uses 0G's `createZGComputeNetworkBroker` to interact with the 0G Compute network.

Automatically discovers available AI models, acknowledges providers, and fetches metadata.

Tracks and manages ledger balances:
- Computes required fees for inference requests
- Performs automatic top-ups if the user's balance is insufficient
- Ensures smooth, uninterrupted compute execution

Sends inference prompts enforcing structured JSON output for consistent downstream processing.

Processes AI responses via `broker.inference.processResponse` before storing insights.

Persists outputs to 0G storage and updates Vault smart contract with category and summary data.

#### Technical Highlights

- Provider acknowledgement & metadata fetch ensures every request targets a validated AI service
- Automatic ledger management reduces friction and prevents failed computations
- Robust logging & error handling captures failures at every step, from RPC interaction to inference output parsing

### Frontend Integration

#### Insights Page

**File:** `app/dashboard/insights/page.tsx`

Coordinates the Model Dashboard, AI Insights panel, and Vault Compute wizard.

Guides users through file selection → AI compute → result visualization.

Visualizes progress in real-time, reflecting inference completion and file grouping.

#### Vault Compute Wizard

**File:** `components/vault/VaultComputeDemo.tsx`

Interactive workflow:
- Upload & review files
- AI computation with progress tracking
- Categorized results with concise summaries in tabbed layout

#### UI Components

- Cards for each file and AI-generated summary
- Tabs for category-based organization
- Buttons with loading indicators to show step-wise computation
- Scrollable modal for large file sets

## Component Flow

```
A[User uploads/selects file] --> B[File stored on 0G Vault]
B --> C[Compute request sent via 0G Broker]
C --> D[Provider acknowledged & metadata fetched]
D --> E[Ledger checked & auto top-up if needed]
E --> F[Inference request executed, JSON results returned]
F --> G[Process response & persist insights to 0G Storage]
G --> H[Vault contract updated with insights]
H --> I[User views categorized results in dashboard]
```

## System Architecture

**Compute Layer** – 0G network provides scalable AI inference services with model discovery, versioning, and metadata management.

**Ledger Management** – Tracks total, locked, and available funds with automatic top-ups.

**Vault Layer** – Secure file storage with root hash verification, smart contract updates, and auditability.

**Frontend Layer** – Real-time insights visualization, progress tracking, and demo wizard fallback.

## End-to-End Workflow

1. Users upload files to the Vault
2. Compute broker discovers AI models and sends structured JSON prompts
3. AI outputs are processed, stored in 0G, and reflected on-chain
4. Ledger balances are automatically topped up to prevent failed requests
5. Results are displayed in responsive UI, grouped by category, with concise summaries

**Note:** While our deposited 0G tokens are currently locked, users can still experience the full workflow using the Vault Demo Wizard, which mirrors the production flow with interactive test data.

## Setting the Stage for Multi-Domain Intelligence

This fully integrated compute and Vault system lays the foundation for specialized domain agents in the final wave.

### Core Features:

- **Finance Agent:** Analyzes spending and suggests optimizations
- **Travel Agent:** Learns preferences from past trips
- **Subscription Agent:** Tracks all recurring payments

### Key Concept

All agents draw from a single data Vault, enabling multi-domain intelligence while maintaining secure, auditable, and organized file insights.

**Demo Impact:** "One data vault powers three different specialized agents" – showcasing scalability and modularity.

## Technical Benefits

- **Production-Ready:** Fully integrated with 0G Compute & Storage, and Vault smart contract
- **Scalable:** Handles large file sets and multiple concurrent users
- **Secure:** Multi-layer encryption and verified ledger interactions
- **User-Friendly:** Real-time feedback and intuitive UI flow for file insights
- **Transparent & Traceable:** Every step logged, auditable, and verifiable on-chain
- **Future-Proof:** Designed to expand into domain-specific INFT agents, demonstrating modularity and multi-domain intelligence
